# OpenZeppelin
OpenZeppelin provides security products to build, automate, and operate decentralized applications. It is a library for secure smart contract development built on Solidity. It's a great choice for developers looking to ensure their project's security and reliability.

### Getting Started

To get started with OpenZeppelin, you'll first need to have Node.js and npm installed. Once you have those, you can install the OpenZeppelin Contracts library using npm:
```
1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to your project directory.
3. Run the following command to install OpenZeppelin Contracts via npm:
   ```
   npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
   ```
4. Once the installation is complete, you can start using OpenZeppelin by importing the contracts you need into your Solidity files.

For example, to use the ERC20 token contract, add the following line to your Solidity file:
